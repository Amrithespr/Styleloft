Web application for booking services and timeslots in a salon in your nearby location. Also added an e-commerce app for selling cosmetic products. And integrated a payment system into it. Here
we create a web application connecting users with their nearby beauty salons. By login, the user can enter into the application to find nearby beauty salons and by selecting a salon he can view
its address or location and its website if present. It contains the services they provide along with its price. The user can choose the service that they want and a convenient timeslot according to 
availability. Already booked timeslots will be shown on the page itself. The shop owner has to register in the web application to make their shop available on the web application.They have to give 
the details of their shop, its services, and the time of availability. Admin maintains the web application by monitoring the details provided in the web application and do the basic crud operations.
